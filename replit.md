# Overview

This is a Python-based player monitoring bot designed to track online players in a gaming environment. The bot continuously monitors player activity, detects when players join or leave, and logs the changes. It's built as a foundation that can be extended to integrate with various gaming platforms, Discord servers, or other online services.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Components

**Monitoring Engine**: The `PlayersOnlineBot` class serves as the main orchestrator, implementing a polling-based architecture that periodically checks for online players. This approach was chosen for simplicity and reliability, avoiding the complexity of real-time event streams.

**State Management**: The bot maintains an in-memory list of currently online players and tracks the last check timestamp. This lightweight approach allows for quick comparisons to detect player status changes without requiring persistent storage.

**Change Detection**: Uses set comparison to efficiently identify when players join or leave, triggering appropriate event handlers when changes occur.

**Logging System**: Implements Python's built-in logging module with timestamp formatting for monitoring bot activity and debugging purposes.

**Extensible Design**: The `get_current_players()` method is designed as a stub that can be easily replaced with actual integrations (game servers, Discord APIs, etc.), following the template method pattern.

## Design Patterns

**Template Method**: The bot provides a framework where specific player detection logic can be implemented by overriding the `get_current_players()` method.

**Observer Pattern**: The `on_players_changed()` method (referenced but not implemented) suggests an event-driven architecture for handling player status changes.

# External Dependencies

**Python Standard Library**: Utilizes built-in modules including `time`, `logging`, `datetime`, `typing`, and `random` for core functionality.

**Potential Integrations** (not yet implemented):
- Game server APIs for actual player data
- Discord Bot APIs for server member monitoring  
- Database systems for persistent player history
- Web APIs for external gaming platforms
- Notification services for alerts

The current implementation uses mock data generation for testing purposes, making it ready for integration with real data sources.
